Every commuter knew Track 9 as the platform with the broken clock and the bitter coffee cart.

Only Milo knew that after midnight, when the final train passed, a panel in the retaining wall slid open to reveal a greenhouse bathed in warm amber light.

He found tomatoes the size of lanterns, basil that smelled like rain, and a woman in a station uniform from fifty years ago trimming vines with silver shears.

"We grow what the city forgets," she told him. "Take one basket each night and leave a memory in return."

By winter, the market stalls sold impossible fruit, and Milo could no longer remember his father's face. The tomatoes, however, tasted exactly like Sunday dinners.
