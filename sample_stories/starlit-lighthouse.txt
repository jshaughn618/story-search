The lighthouse keeper had not seen a ship in three months, but every night she lit the tower as if a fleet were due by dawn.

On the ninety-first evening, a single horn sounded from the fog. She ran the spiral stairs and found no vessel, only a rowboat tied to the rocks and a brass key in its seat.

The key fit the locked room beneath the lantern. Inside, old ledgers listed storms that never happened and rescues that no one remembered. Her own name appeared on the next blank line.

At sunrise the fog lifted. A ship waited offshore, anchored in calm water, flying no flag. She understood then: the light was not to guide sailors home, but to summon the ones who had already been lost.
