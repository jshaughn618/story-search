Nora inherited a map that only appeared when it rained.

Dry, it looked blank. Wet, blue lines spread across the paper, sketching streets that did not exist in any atlas.

She followed one route through an alley behind her apartment and emerged in a neighborhood where every building was a library and every library was open all night.

A librarian stamped her wrist instead of a card and whispered, "You can check out one question. Answers are due in seven days."

Nora borrowed, "What was I supposed to become?" The map stayed visible all week, and by the time the ink faded she had signed a lease for a tiny storefront and painted "Map Repairs" on the window.
