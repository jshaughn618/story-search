The museum advertised silence as its final exhibit.

Visitors surrendered their phones, watches, and shoes at the entrance. Inside, rooms displayed objects that had outlived their stories: a violin missing one string, a typewriter with a single key polished smooth, a wedding ring flattened into an oval.

Curator Elias guided tours without speaking. At the end he handed each guest a card: "Choose one object and tell it what happened next."

Most people wrote a sentence and left. Mara stayed until dusk, filling six cards about the ring.

The next morning the ring was gone from its pedestal. In its place sat a note in careful ink: "Thank you. I remember now."
