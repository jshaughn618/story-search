In Sandglass City, noon happened twice.

At the first noon, merchants opened their shutters and sold clocks that ran backward. At the second noon, the same merchants closed without counting money, claiming profit would be measured tomorrow.

An archivist named Ren discovered why when she repaired the municipal hourglass: half the grains were ordinary sand, half were powdered letters from undelivered mail.

Every day the city repeated one hour to give stray messages one more chance to arrive.

Ren spent her second noon writing the same note to her brother across the sea. On the forty-third repetition, a gull landed at her desk with his reply tied to its leg.
